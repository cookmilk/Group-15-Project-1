Project Description: 
	Depression is often linked to feelings of inactivity and discouragement. Studies have shown that increased activity can increase the chances of having more postiive experiences. A Cognitive Behavioral Diary (CBT Diary) primarily is used to allow a user to write down their feelings and breakdown the causes and cut out the negativity from those thoughts. 
	
	By creating an application that both encourages activity and reinforces positive thoughts through its diary capabilites, Spark becomes the ultimate self help tool for those suffering from stress, anxiety or depression.
